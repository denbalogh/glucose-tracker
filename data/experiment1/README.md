### First batch of data

I tried getting 4 types of sensor data, each type having a different intergration time.

I chose integration time values 50, 100, 150, 200.

My goal was to test whether there is a difference in quality of the data based on the integration time.

I collected data when I was fasted and after meal.

There are statistically significant differences in the collected data when fasted and when satiated(after meal).

The integration time doesn't seem to have an effect on the statistical difference however, so I decided to use the lowest value for the next data collection, because it takes less amount of time and therefore results in quicker data collection.
