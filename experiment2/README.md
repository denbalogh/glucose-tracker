### Second experiment

I collected several batches of data when I was fasted and when I was satiated.

I did statistical test between these batches to find out whether there are statistically significant differences.

I randomly sampled 2 sets of data from the same batch and did the test. There were no statistically significant differences.

I did the same sampling from 2 different batches of fasted and satiated data. There were statistically significant differences.

I then tried to do the same sampling from 2 different batches of the same type of data when I was fasted. There also were statistically significant differences.

I suspect these are caused by differences in temperature of the skin from where the data is being collected.
